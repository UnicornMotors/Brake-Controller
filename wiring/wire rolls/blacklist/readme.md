Though advertised 10 10 Gauge, this is more like 14, maybe even 16.

1.0 out of 5 stars Its cheap desolving aluminum wire!
Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2019

Its aluminum wire which desolves in mosture and electrolysis.

If you use this wire be prepared to do the job over in 6 months or a year.

It also has far more resistance to electricity thsn copper so you need a larger diameter wire to do the same job.

1.0 out of 5 stars NOT 10 GAUGE WIRE NOT EVEN 16 GAUGE

This is NOT 10 gauge. This is 18gauge at best. I read the reviews and just thought there were a couple unhappy people. This stuff is thinner than the 14gauge wire I was replacing. If you want 16gauge wire but you want to be able to tell your friends you are running 10, then this is what you want. If you actually want what you pay for then don't buy this.

1.0 out of 5 stars BEWARE! PAY ATTENTION! If you think you are getting real 10 GA wire you will be disappointed!

BEWARE! PAY ATTENTION! If you think you are getting real 10 GA wire you will be disappointed! I'm not sure what else 10 Gauge could possibly mean but they have made up their own system to deceive people and sell them less wire then they think they are getting. The copper in this wire measures out to 12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) not 10 AWG. Copper is expensive, they are saving money and taking advantage of people's ignorance of electronics. Get a cheap pair of digital calipers and put them in your toolbox. When you buy wire, measure the diameter of the COPPER ONLY. 10 Gauge wire should be approx. 2.5mm in diameter. 12 gauge is 2.05mm in diameter. Unfortunately you can't trust many offshore manufacturers anymore. Arm yourself with the right tools and knowledge to protect your wallet.

1.0 out of 5 stars CCA wire - NOT OFC Pure Copper
Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019

As others have said it is misleading. I opened and will use for a very small low watt system in a seldom used room. I would not use on anything with any power or if you have to connect to a true copper wire you MUST follow proper procedure for connecting CCA wire to copper wire.

Not as pictured. Description/text misleading. I ordered this and received COPPER CLAD ALUMINUM. The ad clearly states 100% oxygen free copper so to call that misleading is more than generous.

Coper-Clad Aluminum (CCA) garbage (not oxygen-free copper as implied in the description), and nowhere near 10AWG. These wires have a very thick jacket and fewer conductors than 12AWG wires do. I guess this goes back to Amazon.

1.0 out of 5 stars NOT OFC COPPER, copper-plated aluminium
Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020
Verified Purchase
It clearly says Oxygen free copper, and it is clearly copper plated aluminum. For what I was using it for, it stripped the copper plating off of where I had it connected and heated up due to resistance and almost started a fire. Copper-plated aluminum can't conduct as much as current as full OFC can, and has a higher resistance.
