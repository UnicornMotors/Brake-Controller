1.0 out of 5 stars Its cheap desolving aluminum wire!

Its aluminum wire which desolves in mosture and electrolysis.

If you use this wire be prepared to do the job over in 6 months or a year.

It also has far more resistance to electricity thsn copper so you need a larger diameter wire to do the same job.

1.0 out of 5 stars NOT 10 GAUGE WIRE NOT EVEN 16 GAUGE

This is NOT 10 gauge. This is 18gauge at best. I read the reviews and just thought there were a couple unhappy people. This stuff is thinner than the 14gauge wire I was replacing. If you want 16gauge wire but you want to be able to tell your friends you are running 10, then this is what you want. If you actually want what you pay for then don't buy this.

1.0 out of 5 stars BEWARE! PAY ATTENTION! If you think you are getting real 10 GA wire you will be disappointed!

BEWARE! PAY ATTENTION! If you think you are getting real 10 GA wire you will be disappointed! I'm not sure what else 10 Gauge could possibly mean but they have made up their own system to deceive people and sell them less wire then they think they are getting. The copper in this wire measures out to 12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) not 10 AWG. Copper is expensive, they are saving money and taking advantage of people's ignorance of electronics. Get a cheap pair of digital calipers and put them in your toolbox. When you buy wire, measure the diameter of the COPPER ONLY. 10 Gauge wire should be approx. 2.5mm in diameter. 12 gauge is 2.05mm in diameter. Unfortunately you can't trust many offshore manufacturers anymore. Arm yourself with the right tools and knowledge to protect your wallet.
