This is garbage wire. DO NOT BUY IT. I make and repair wire harnesses for a living on ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles and have used dozens of different brands and types of wire for 12dcv and 24dcv trucks. Typically I'd avoid CCA wire altogether, but wanted to try this stuff out based on the relatively low cost. The wire itself is under-gauge, brittle, and is fairly high resistance for the gauge. There also is no up-sized ground in the 7. The jacket is typical cheap Chineseium; it's super stiff at room temp, doesn't take heat AT ALL, and the outer is HALF the thickness of a 'decent' quality domestic wire. Needless to say it's getting returned.

The outer covering does not hold up in cold weather. When the outside temps dropped below freezing the outer covering became extremely brittle and broke when the cable was moved.
We didn’t discover this issue until well after the return window had closed so I’m stuck with 500’ of cable that won’t work.

First of all, if you’ve ever used 7 wire for automotive or trailer wiring you know that the wire is braided in a certain way so that the wires are all lined up to go straight into the back of a light plug. These are not. They are just randomly braided in no certain order. Also the black wire inside is purple instead of black

The worst part is that the first day the temperature was below 40 degrees the weather coating on the outside of the wire began cracking anywhere the wire had a minor bend in it. And I’m not talking about a sharp bend or kink. I mean a soft gentle curve and it cracked in multiple places and then split.

It’s junk. Buy the good stuff from your auto parts store
