Some Cost calculations, on different Kits Vs. "Do It Yourself" with quality components at minimal cost.
* The most expensive component is the Wire
- we blacklist wires that are Misadvertised: the wrong gauge, or copper-clad-aluminum
- the best quality Bulk wire you can buy is called "Marine wire" and is made for Outdoor and Corrosive environments. Works perfect for the frames of automobiles!
